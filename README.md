# 🎟️ Rezerve Smart Seat Booking & Dynamic Pricing Backend System

A microservices-based backend system designed for smart, dynamic event seat booking with real-time pricing adjustments, distributed communication, and robust observability.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Rezerve** is a distributed, event-driven microservices system built with **Spring Boot**, enabling users to book seats for various events (Movies, Concerts, Flights, Buses, Trains) while supporting **dynamic pricing**, **fault-tolerant booking orchestration**, and **real-time notifications**.

It integrates **Kafka**, **Redis**, **gRPC**, and **PostgreSQL** with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring, providing an end-to-end scalable backend architecture similar to real-world systems like BookMyShow or Ticketmaster.

## 🧩 Microservices

| Service | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Auth Service** | Handles user registration, login, JWT authentication, role management, and inter-service token validation. Sends user-created events via Kafka. |
| **Event Service** | Manages events (travel-based & venue-based). Uses Redis caching for performance and publishes new events to **Inventory** and **Pricing** services via Kafka. |
| **Inventory Service** | Manages seat availability with concurrency control via **Redisson locks**. Handles seat booking and release and publishes updates to **Pricing Service**. |
| **Booking Service** | Orchestrator service implementing the **Orchestration SAGA Pattern**. Manages booking lifecycle using gRPC calls, Redis TTL for pending bookings, and Kafka for event coordination. |
| **Payment Service** | Handles booking payments. Validates booking via gRPC with **Booking Service** and sends asynchronous success/failure notifications via Kafka to **Notification Service**. |
| **Pricing Service** | Implements the **Choreography SAGA Pattern**. Dynamically adjusts prices based on event type and seat availability from Kafka messages sent by **Inventory Service**. |
| **Notification Service** | Listens to user creation and payment events via Kafka. Sends templated HTML emails using **Java Mail Sender** and **Thymeleaf**, storing sent data in MongoDB. |
| **API Gateway** | Single entry point for all clients. Routes requests to respective services and validates JWT tokens with **Auth Service**. |
| **Prometheus & Grafana** | Collects and visualizes system metrics across all services for observability and monitoring. |

## 🔄 Booking Event Flow — Orchestration SAGA Pattern

> This flow demonstrates how a booking request travels through the system — showcasing how the **Booking Service** orchestrates calls between **Event**, and **Inventory** services, ensuring consistency through compensating actions and Redis TTL-based rollback.

### Flow Summary

1. **User initiates booking** through API Gateway → Booking Service.  
2. Booking Service calls **Event Service (gRPC)** to verify event existence and pricing.  
3. Calls **Inventory Service (gRPC)** to confirm seat availability.  
4. Creates provisional booking in PostgreSQL and Redis (with TTL = 10 mins).  
5. Returns booking ID to the client.

## 💰 Dynamic Pricing Flow — Choreography SAGA Pattern

> The pricing updates are handled in a fully **decentralized, event-driven manner** using Kafka. Services react to events rather than direct orchestration calls, implementing a **Choreography SAGA Pattern**.

### Flow Summary

1. **Inventory Service** publishes seat updated events to Kafka.  
2. **Pricing Service** consumes these events to calculate new prices dynamically based on seat availability and event type.  
3. Updated price information is sent to **Event Service** via Kafka.  
4. **Event Service** updates event pricing in PostgreSQL and Redis cache.  
5. No central coordinator — each service reacts autonomously to events.

### 📊 Observability Stack (Prometheus + Grafana)

All microservices expose **Prometheus metrics** through the Spring Boot Actuator endpoint (`/actuator/prometheus`).  
These metrics are scraped by **Prometheus** and visualized in **Grafana** using custom dashboards.

#### Monitored Metrics:

- 🕒 **Uptime**  
- ⏰ **Start Time**  
- 💾 **Heap Memory Used**  
- 🧠 **Non-Heap Memory Used**  
- ⚙️ **CPU Usage**  
- 📈 **System Load Average**  
- 🧩 **JVM Statistics**  
  - G1 Eden Space (heap)  
  - G1 Old Gen (heap)  
  - G1 Survivor Space (heap)  
- 🔌 **HikariCP Statistics**  
  - Connection Pool Size  
  - Connection Timeout Count  
  - Active Connections  
- 🌐 **HTTP Statistics**  
  - Request Count  
  - Average Response Time  

These metrics provide visibility into **service performance**, **resource utilization**, and **request behavior** across all microservices, enabling proactive performance tuning and system health tracking.
